!NOTE
* FDD is about the fail I have seen and participated in
* Really, it's about you and how you can avoid it
* But I'm going to relate it all to my personal life...
* Because it made writing the slides more fun...
* Because I thought you guys would get a laugh out of it...
* And, because, hell, it felt pretty fucking cathartic for me!
